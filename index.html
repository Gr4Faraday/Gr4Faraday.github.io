                Mechanical, aerospace, civil, chemical, and biological engineering, geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and biology are just a few of the<br/> 
                fields where it might be used .It is the study of how fluids respond to forces applied to them.Fluid Mechanics is also the discipline of science that examines<br/>
                the behavior of fluids in motion and at rest. Whether the fluid is at rest or motion, it is subjected to diverse forces and different environmental conditions<br/>
                and it responds in these conditions as per its physical qualities. It is concerned with three elements of fluids: statics, kinematics, and dynamics. Surface <br/>
                tension, fluid statics, flow in enclosed bodies or flow round bodies (solid or otherwise), flow stability, and other issues are addressed in this subject field. <br/> 
                In reality, nearly every move a human takes involves some sort of fluid mechanics problem. <br/></p></span>
